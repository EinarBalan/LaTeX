\chapter{K-Nearest Neighbors}
 KNN is a type of supervised learning classifier which uses proximity to make classifications. It can be useful to determine a category for something i.e. spam or not spam, or type of flower. KNN is quite good at this.

 \subsection*{Basic Algorithm}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Learning: just store training samples
    \item Prediction: Find k existing examples closest to input and group them; construct new labels based on k Neighbors
    \item Issues:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Need to define distance based on the domain i.e. Euclidean, Manhattan, L-p norm, Hamming (\# diff bits), etc.
        \item What is the best value of k?
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
